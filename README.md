# Exploratory Data Analysis on Global Terrorism Dataset - Mentorness Internship

Welcome to my GitHub repository for the Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on the Global Terrorism Dataset. This project was completed as part of my internship with Mentorness, where I explored terrorism-related data to uncover insights into global trends, regions affected, and key factors contributing to terrorism incidents.

## üìã Project Objectives

### Key Goals
- Analyze the temporal trends in global terrorism incidents.
- Identify the countries and regions most affected by terrorism.
- Explore attack types, target types, and weapon usage in terrorism.
- Examine the impact of terrorism, including casualties and fatalities over time.

### Insights Uncovered
- **Temporal Trends**: Analyzed yearly terrorism incidents to identify patterns and fluctuations over time.
- **Regional Analysis**: Identified the most affected countries and regions by the frequency of incidents.
- **Attack Methods**: Investigated the types of attacks used (e.g., bombings, armed assaults) and their prevalence.
- **Casualties**: Analyzed fatalities and injuries to understand the severity and impact of terrorism events.
- **Targeted Sectors**: Explored the most common targets of terrorism, including government, military, and civilian sectors.

## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used
- **Python**: Used for data processing, analysis, and visualization.
- **Pandas**: To handle and analyze structured data.
- **Matplotlib/Seaborn**: For creating informative and insightful visualizations.
- **Jupyter Notebook**: For executing the analysis and documenting findings.

## üìÇ Repository Overview
- **Data Preprocessing**: Code for cleaning, handling missing values, and transforming the dataset.
- **EDA Scripts**: Python scripts (.ipynb) that carry out exploratory analysis and generate visualizations.
- **Visual Outputs**: Graphs and charts illustrating key findings.

## üí° Conclusion
This EDA project provided a deeper understanding of global terrorism trends, highlighting critical regions and attack patterns that can aid policymakers, security agencies, and analysts in their decision-making processes. The skills developed during this project are crucial for my career in data science and analytics.
